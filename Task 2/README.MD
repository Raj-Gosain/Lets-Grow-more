In this exciting project, I completed the challenging task of developing a robust stock price prediction model for one of the world's leading e-commerce giants, Amazon. Leveraging my data science skills, I performed extensive data analysis and feature engineering to extract valuable insights from historical stock market data. By implementing cutting-edge machine learning algorithms, including time series forecasting techniques, I accurately forecasted Amazon's stock prices, enabling stakeholders to make informed investment decisions.

Key Highlights:

Conducted comprehensive data exploration and preprocessing to ensure high-quality data inputs.
Utilized LSTM-based time series forecasting to predict future stock prices.
Visualized historical closing prices, rolling mean, and standard deviation for deeper insights.
Employed volume analysis and moving averages to understand trading activity patterns.
Provided valuable predictions to assist stakeholders in making informed investment decisions.
